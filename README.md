**Heart Rate Bridge** allows your application to communicate with the Heart Rate Monitor application, receiving the measured Heart rate. You can save and show this data as part of your application.
<br><br>The Heart Rate Monitor uses Camera Fusion algorithms to measure the Heart Rate with incredible accuracy. Unlike other algorithms, it works even without a flash.
<br><br>We believe this will help developers to add accurate heart rate tracking in their own health applications.
<br><br>Your application does not need CAMERA permission to measure Heart rate. It is handled by the bridge.
<br><br>This demo application is open source and available on Github. More customization options to match your application style, will be available soon.
<br><br>Open a new issue in Github, if you have any issues with the demo or the bridge.
